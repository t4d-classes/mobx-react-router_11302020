# Exercise 6

1. Create a new folder named "containers". In the folder, create two new components named Car Form Container and Car Table Container. These two components will serve as the container components for the Car Form and Car Table components, respectively.

2. Change the Car Tool Page component to a non-container component. Do not pass props to the Car Tool component (the one in the components folder).

3. Utilize the two new container components inside of Car Tool component (the one in the components folder) replacing the current calls to Car Table and Car Form. 

4. Ensure all of the original functionality for Car Tool works as usual.
